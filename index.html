	<h2>About my jack</h2>
	<p>His first cry was in 14 june 2012 and we brought him at 14 june 2014 [actually it was his birthday].He was only two years old ut he looked like a six years old dog.[the photo below this paragraph is the first photo taken by me after he came to our house maybe 1 or 2 week after] first of all jack was a suprise gift for me for my 8th birthday and i can't beleive him that he was only 2 years or [maybe the dog owner fooled us] my friends also did not beleive me that he was only 2 years old.He was a good and obedient boy but still he has a bad habit of going out of the house when opening our house gates but still he was a good boy. He lived upto 2019 [7 years ] and passed out at 2019  april.</p>

	<h2>my jack's talents:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>He will fetch the ball or stick if you throw</li>
	<li>he has a keen sense of smell and hearing that he will start to bark even it was a kid footsteps or a rustle of bushes</li>
	<li>he is a like a friendly type but if you irritate him by taking his things or disturbs him while eating he will get very angry even it was his owner [ me 'cause i have already met a attack like this]</li>

<h3>my jack's naughtiness </h3>
	<!-- naughtiness -->
	<li>He will poop wherever he wants [you can see  it in the second pic]</li>
	<li>For the first time we were all scared about him so that we tied him in our railings, but if you come and see the next morning he will bite and tear the rope and he will be roaming around the house </li>
	<li>At every morning one slipper will be lost and the next day it will be found with the one which comes between our fingers will be lost but our slipper will be there </li>
